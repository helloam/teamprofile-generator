# Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Task

This task required me to build a Node.js CLI that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing was also a requirement to making code maintainable, so I had to write a unit test for every part of the code and ensured that it passed each test.
